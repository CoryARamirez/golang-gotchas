# Go Gotchas!

This is a simple set of slides where we show some of the weird things about Go. Things
that for new people to the language may feel weird, but there's a good reason for those
things to happen. Some times, it's related to the language itself, some others about
referencing and deferefencing data and so on.

### How to see the slides

Just clone the project, and then download the Go present tool:

```bash
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

Then access the directory where this code was cloned and run the present tool. If you also
want to have access to the runnable examples, just run with `-play=true` parameter set.
